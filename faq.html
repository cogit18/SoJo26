            <h3 class="collapsible">>Q: $30 per person?! Why so much?</h3>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>A: The first year we did this in 2018, we hoped to break even on over $1,000 in expenses, and we <i>only</i> lost $35 when all was said and done. Considering we did a full catered dinner for 70 people, that felt pretty good.</p>
                <p>This year we aren't doing a dinner, but we have almost as many planned expenses with paid venues and activities that are going to really surprise and delight. Ask someone who ran it in 2024 if it is worth the cost.</p>

            <h3 class="collapsible">>Q: How difficult will it be?</h3>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>A: Check out the <a href="SoJo24Recap.html">2024 recap</a> to see the challenges from last time. For 2026 we added a delayed hint to every mental challenge, and there is validation with colors to let you know you're on the right track. You can see an example of that with this year's <a href="Qual.html">Qualifiers</a>.</p>
                <p>Puzzles aren't fun unless they push you; they just become tedious. Monotony instead of accomplishment. At the same time, we don't want teams to be stuck early on and get discouraged. So we are striking a balance this year: you are rewarded for getting a headstart, and everyone is helped along the way.</p>

            <h3 class="collapsible">>Q: How much physical activity is required?</h3>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>A: Teams that run will have an advantage. Do you have to run? No; just have fun.</p>
                <p>There are certain physical challenges that only some team members will need to do, and teams can choose who will participate.</p>

            <h3 class="collapsible">>Q: What are the boundaries?</h3>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>A: We don't want people to spend the race driving (and ignoring speed limits). So most of the activities are relatively close to each other.</p>
                <p>We currently have two locations that are just outside of South Jordan. We'll confirm final boundaries at the starting line.</p>

            <h3 class="collapsible">>Q: What do we need to bring?</h3>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>A: This is an all-weather event, so bring anything you personally want for the weather. We will end with a gardening volunteer project for a non-profit, so bring work/gardening gloves and wear clothes you won't mind getting dirty.</p>
                    <p>Also bring one per team:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>An 8.5" x 11" notebook and writing tool.</li>
                        <li>A beach towel you don't care about.</li>
                        <li>A shovel.</li>
                        <li>A metal rake.</li>

                <p>A: Review the <a href="SoJo24Recap.html">2024 recap</a>, make sure you understand the <a href="Qual.html">Qualifiers</a>.</p>
                <p><ul>
                    <li>Make sure you know how to scan QR codes with your phone.</li>
                    <li>Really play around with What3Words; we'll use that again.</li>
